## Project Schedule
This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.

You are responsible for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding Saturday and Sunday.

# Project Description
<!-- Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality. -->

Simple sleek web portfolio with an exploration in shades of blue and their contrast with neon greens. Classic stylisized cards go from simple single column in mobile to a carousel in tablet to a four by four grid in desktop. In the tablet and above breakpoint a picture of myself is included in the about section hero as well as changing the nav icon to display sections in nav bar instead of drop down. 

The site is designed to be updated and added on as I learn more things. The MVP is a functional website with a few solid jquery animations, nav page  links, and three solid viewports.

## Inspiration:
- [really cool animations](https://caferati.me/)
- [mvp focused portfolio website](https://mattfarley.ca/)

## Scratchpad low fidelity ideas
  #### minimal website layout
  - landing page 
   - hamburger icon - (on page scroll to sections)
    - sections: 
     - about (quick bio, picture, experience, what i do)
     - projects (links to websites, hosted projects etc.) - thinking this could be simple box grid
     - contact & current job seeking status or collab status (like - currently searching a forever coding home, or i've got time to collab on projects!)

## Wireframes
<!-- Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Do not include the actual image and have it render on the page. -->

Wireframing Resources:

- Mockflow
- Figma
- Time/Priority Matrix
- Link
Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the Time and Priority Matix. This involves drawing a a square. In the middle of the square, on the x axis draw a line. The most left part of the line should start with 0hrs and the end of the line should include 2hrs. This line will be used to estimate how much time any one feature will take to complete.

Now draw a vertical line on the y axis. The top of this line should have High and the bottom Low. This line will be used to assign a priority to to each feature you wish to include in the project.

Now create a separate list starting with A and assign it one of the features. Continue to assign each feature a letter. Once complete add each letter to the matrix assigning based on what your feel it's prioirty is an how long it will take to implement. If any one feature takes longer than 2hrs to complete than break it down into smaller tasks and reassign them a new letter.

Once complete tally up the time and determine how long the project will take to complete. Now break those features into MVP and PostMVP so you can guarantee you will have a fully functioning project to demo. -->

# MVP/PostMVP - 5min
<!-- The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP. Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion. -->

Mobile version complete with scaling grid columns going from single in mobile, double in tablet, triple in desktop.



<!-- ## MVP (examples)
- Pull data using google json api
- Render data on page
- Allow user to choose favorites
- Save their choices in firebase
- PostMVP
- Anything else that is not MVP
- Functional Components
Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into smaller components. Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all phases of the portfolio. Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the portfolio must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. -->
